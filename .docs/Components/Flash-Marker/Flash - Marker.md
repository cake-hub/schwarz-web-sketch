# Marker

The marker component belongs - like [bubble](../Flash-Bubble/Flash%20-%20Bubble.md), [corner](../Flash-Corner/Flash%20-%20Corner.md) and [frame](../Flash-Frame/Flash%20-%20Frame.md) - to the group of **flashes**.

Use the different flashes to emphasize messages with a strong meaning.

---

## Recommendations

- All flash elements should be used sparingly to avoid overload.
- Please use the marker only for a maximum text length of one to four lines.

---

## Overall styling

- The text-style depends on the component and is always [basic bold](../../General/Typography/Typography.md#basic-bold).
- The line-height is always **120%**.
- The marker has **no hover-** or **focus-state**.

---

## Variants
