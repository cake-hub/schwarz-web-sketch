# Pagination

Pagination is used to spread content or data over multiple pages.

It allows the user to jump to the respective pages by browsing.

---

## Recommendations

- Use the provided pagination as the simplest and smallest solution.
- The complete pagination can be placed either left, centered or right on a web page.
- It can also be placed above and below the page content.

---

## Overall styling

- The width depends on the number of shown digits or arrows.
- It is only scalable by adding up the digits or arrows.
- The text-style always is **basic**.
- The line-height is always **120%**.
- The text is centered within the textbox.
- The background is **basic-white**.
- Use „arrow-left“ and „arrow-right“ as icons.
- **Only arrows can be disabled!**

## What can be modified?

- Override the digits.
- Modify paginations for your project needs by adding or deleting single pagination symbols (i.e. like more digits or more arrows).

### Our workflow in Sketch

- Change the states of indexing and arrows using the "Overrides"-function.
