# Images

These elements are used as placeholders in symbols or on mockups.

---

## Recommendations

- There is a lot to consider when selecting the appropriate image component.
- To make layouting with pictures easier, we recommend that the picture symbols follow our 8pt grid - both in width and height.
- Furthermore, the sample content should always be adapted to the appropriate aspect ratio.
- You shouldn't use too many different image formats in one layout, as fewer image formats are better suited for use in design, production and website performance.


| Ratio | Description | Example |
|--|--|--|
| Free ratio | The image scales as large as possible.<br>Use this format for almost all UX elements or background images.<br>Height and width can be random but should always be divisible by 8. | ![logo: image free ratio](assets/free-ratio@1x.png) |
|4:3 ratio | Can only be used in a ratio of 4:3.<br>Mainly used for product images or teasers. <br>The fixed aspect ratio also ensures that the images look the same everywhere and, for example, are not cropped. | ![logo: image 4:3](assets/4-3-ratio@1x.png) |

## What can be modified?

- Override the content.
- Adjust the ratio (only "free-ratio" symbol).
- Adjust height and width.

### Our workflow in Sketch

- These symbols are always placeholders.
- These placeholders can later easy be replaced by inserting sample content images.
- To set an image, use the "Overrides" function "Choose Image".
