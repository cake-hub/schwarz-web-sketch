## Recommendations

- Please keep in mind that this element is just a decorative element.
- It can be used as a highlight element before texts or free in the layout.

### Overall styling

- The shape can be filled within any **basic-**, **brand-primary-base-**, **gray-color**.
- The element can only be scaled proportionally.
- There is no outlined keyvisual available.

---

## Spacing & Measurements

- In combination with a text, the height of the key visual is based on the verse height of the text.

| Types | Attributes | Preview |
|---|---|---|
| Height | x-height of the text element | ![keyvisual: height](assets/measurement/height@1x.png) |
| Distance | optically aligned | ![keyvisual: distance](assets/measurement/distance@1x.png) |
| Angle | Outer angle: 26°<br>Inner angle: 128° | ![keyvisual: angle](assets/measurement/angle@1x.png) |

## What can be modified?

- Override the color.
- Adjust the size proportionally.

### Our workflow in Sketch

- To individualize the decorative key visual in your **product** you need to detach/unlink the complete symbol from the CAKE UI Kit.
- Used the element specifically and scale the single symbol to the right width or height.
