# Links

A reference for the user that can lead directly to an external or internal destination by clicking or tapping on it.

---

## Overall styling

- The text-style depends on the body text and is either **small**, **basic** or **large**.
- A link can have multiple states: **default/visited**, **hover/focus**, **active/pressed**.
- The appearance of the state depends on the usage or context.
- There’s also a positive and negative version to layout on a light or dark background.
- The icon can only be placed **before**, **not after** the link.
- Icons are always displayed like in the font color.

---

## Positive version

- Use the positive version if you want to display a link on a light background.
- Always make sure you have enough contrast when choosing the background.

### Our workflow in Sketch

- Take one of the text styles for the different font sizes to display a linked text.
- The text style is then manually adapted to the status to be displayed (e.g. hover/focus: underlined, brand-secondary-base,…).
- Detach the text-style if you want to show a link in a copy-text.
