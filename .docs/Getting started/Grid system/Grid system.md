# Grid System

A grid system can be used to align and size objects within a given format.

---

## Usage

- Basic rules that help you set up your pages in sketch.
- The responsive behavior of our grid has four breakpoints.
- The amount, width and spacing of the columns change with each breakpoint.
- **Exception!** The global header and footer live outside the bounds of the grid.

|  1. Columns | 2. Gutters | 3. Margins |
|--|--|--|
| Content is placed in the areas of the screen that contain columns.<br> The number of displayed columns is determined by the breakpoint that is chosen. | Gutters are the spaces between columns.<br> They help separate content. | Margins are the space between content and the left and right edges of the screen. |
