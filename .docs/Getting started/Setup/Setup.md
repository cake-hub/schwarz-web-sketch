# Setup

How you get access to all our fine CAKE products.

---

## Introduction

- CAKE is available on GitHub.
- Use an external software to get access to our design system library files (e.g. Sourcetree).
- You need the **CAKE UI Fundamental** repository as a global library file linked in Sketch to work with any other CAKE UI product (e.g. App, Chatbot, Web, Mail, … ).
